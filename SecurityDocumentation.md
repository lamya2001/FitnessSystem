Security Documentation

Overview
The fitness system is designed to provide personalized fitness plan recommendations based on user inputs. Security measures have been implemented to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain confidentiality.

1-Encryption and Hashing
>Passwords:
 User passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm before storage.
 Hashed passwords are stored in the credentials file, ensuring plaintext passwords are never stored.
2-User Authentication
>Login System:
 Users are required to log in with a username and password.
 Accounts are created securely, and credentials are verified during the login process.
 Account creation and login processes include validation checks to prevent unauthorized access.
3-Logging and Monitoring
>User Activity Logging:
 User activities are logged in the user_activity.log file.
 The system tracks user logins, logouts, and other significant events.
4-File Handling
>Secure File Operations:
 File handling operations are performed securely to prevent unauthorized access.
 File paths are controlled to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.
5-Error Handling
>Exception Handling:
 Proper exception handling is implemented to prevent sensitive information leakage.
 Errors are logged without revealing detailed system information.
6-Inactivity Timer
>Session Management:
 An inactivity timer is set to log out users after a specific period of inactivity.
 This feature enhances system security by automatically logging out idle users.
7-Secure Communication
>Secure Input Handling:
 User inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
 The system ensures that user inputs do not pose security risks.
8-Access Control
>Access Control Measures:
 Access control mechanisms are in place to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive system functionalities.
 User roles and permissions are enforced to maintain data confidentiality.

Conclusion
The security measures implemented in the fitness system aim to protect user data, ensure system reliability, and prevent security breaches. Regular security audits and updates will be conducted to enhance the overall security posture of the system.
